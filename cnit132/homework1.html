<h2> About Me</h2>
My name is Justin Ino. I am a software engineer at a medical device manufacturing company. I love to be active and travel. In my free time, I like to be with my girlfriend and my dog as well as exercise.


<h2>Web Development Path</h2>
I initially got into web development back in college. I had learned about the certificates here at CCSF and wanted to further explore web development as a possible career change by obtaining my Web Development certificate. <br>
One of my favorite sites to visit is <a href="https://www.theathletic.com" target="_blank">The Athletic</a>. I like to read about sports and find their website to be minimal and easy to use.

<h2>CCSF Counseling</h2>
The counseling department at CCSF is a great way to jumpstart your goals. You can find the department <a href="http://www.ccsf.edu/en/student-services/student-counseling.html#subcontent">here!</a>
