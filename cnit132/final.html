  <h2> About Me</h2>
  <p>My name is Justin Ino. I am a software engineer at a medical device manufacturing company. I love to be active and travel. In my free time, I like to be with my girlfriend and my dog as well as exercise.
    </p>

    <h2>Web Development Path</h2>
  <p>I initially got into web development back in college. I had learned about the certificates here at CCSF and wanted to further explore web development as a possible career change by obtaining my Web Development certificate. <br>
    One of my favorite sites to visit is <a href="https://www.theathletic.com" target="_blank">The Athletic</a>. I like to read about sports and find their website to be minimal and easy to use.</p>
    <h2>CCSF Counseling</h2>
    The <a href="http://www.ccsf.edu/en/student-services/student-counseling.html#subcontent" target="_blank">counseling department</a> at CCSF is a great way to jump start your goals. They've assisted me greatly during my time at CCSF.
